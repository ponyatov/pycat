    "This method is not for a total newbie in programming as you must know Python a bit to start, and have some entry-level programming skills. The Python was selected as it is the most popular programming language now for programming learning, and because this language implementation is so dynamic, as you can implement your own language system atop of PVM runtime. The advantage of learning by reimplementing is you are able not only embed this scripting engine to any software system you are doing but also deeply understand the original Picat."

It was mostly selected to make this language to be not visual but **visualizable**: it is important for the newbies that a learning programming system to be Smalltalk-like interactive and deeply researchable."
